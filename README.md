# Kaggle Playground Series
# S4E8 - Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms

The goal of this competition is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

## My proposed solution
I just got registered in this challenge, I'll code a simple model with XGB/CatBoost/LightGBM and assess the results. If the results aren't the best, I'm gonna code a neural network model, if there are enough observations for training. 

## Final score and classification
To be seen yet. Let's see what my models can do here.
